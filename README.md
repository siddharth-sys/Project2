##Titanic dataset evaluation

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
1. Performed detailed EDA on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights into passenger demographics, survival rates, and feature relationships.
2. Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and removing irrelevant features.
3. Visualized key patterns using bar plots, histograms, heatmaps, and boxplots to analyze the impact of features like age, gender, class, and fare on survival.
4. Identified correlations between features and survival using Seabornâ€™s heatmap and grouped analysis.
5. Derived actionable insights, such as higher survival rates among women and first-class passengers, to support potential predictive modeling.
